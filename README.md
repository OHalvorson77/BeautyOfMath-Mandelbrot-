This is a simple yet powerful tool to visualize the Mandelbrot set, explore its intricate structure, and see the paths that complex numbers take when iteratively mapped. It also allows you to play around in a 
spirograph playground and let you see all the cool art you can make with math.

âœ¨ What are Complex Numbers?
In mathematics, a complex number is a number made up of two parts:

A real part (like ordinary numbers: 3, -1.5, etc.)

An imaginary part, which is a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i, where iÂ² = -1.

A complex number looks like:


z = a + bi

where:

a is the real part

b is the imaginary part

Complex numbers are extremely important in fields like engineering, physics, and fractal geometry!

âœ¨ What is the Mandelbrot Set?
The Mandelbrot set is a famous, infinitely complex fractal shape based on a simple formula involving complex numbers.

The idea is:

Start with z = 0

Repeatedly apply the formula:


z = zÂ² + c
where:

z is a complex number that changes each step

c is a constant complex number (the point you're testing)

If after many iterations the value of z remains bounded (does not escape to infinity), then c belongs to the Mandelbrot set.

If z escapes (its distance from the origin becomes larger than 2), c is outside the Mandelbrot set.

The Mandelbrot set creates a stunningly complex and beautiful boundary!

âœ¨ What This Code Does
This project builds a visualization of the Mandelbrot set and provides interactive features to explore it.

Main Features:

Render the Mandelbrot set onto an HTML5 <canvas>.

Color points based on how quickly they "escape" (how many iterations it takes to diverge).

Customize maximum iterations and color choices with an interactive sidebar.

Hover over the canvas to draw the orbit path (the sequence of points generated by applying z = zÂ² + c starting from z=0).

The orbit path is drawn in white to show how the complex number evolves at that position.

How it works:

Initialization:
The canvas is set up to represent a region of the complex plane (usually real parts from -1.5 to 0.5, imaginary parts from -1.0 to 1.0).

Plotting:
For each pixel (x, y):

Convert the pixel to a complex number c.

Start with z = 0.

Apply z = zÂ² + c up to a maximum number of iterations.

If z escapes (its magnitude becomes greater than 2), color the pixel based on how many iterations it took.

Hover Drawing:
When you move your mouse over the canvas:

The app calculates and draws the full orbit path for the complex point under your mouse.

The path shows the trajectory of z as it evolves under iteration.

Coloring Scheme:

Specific colors are assigned to different iteration counts (especially for 3 to 24 iterations) to give a gradual, visually interesting transition.
